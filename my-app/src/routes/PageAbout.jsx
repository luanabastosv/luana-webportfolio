            Hi! I'm a creator with a background in architecture, graphic design,
            and photography. After over 5 years working in the architecture
            industry, I decided to follow a new path—one that combines logic,
            creativity, and constant learning: web development. Today, I'm
            focused on building clean, functional, and visually engaging
            websites. My multidisciplinary experience helps me bring a unique
            perspective to every project, from design to development. Outside of
            the screen, I'm all about movement and energy. I’m passionate about
            an active lifestyle: surfing (trying, at least), skating, and
            running keep me inspired. And whether it’s a sunrise coffee or a
            late-night coding session, you’ll probably find me with an energy
            drink in hand.
